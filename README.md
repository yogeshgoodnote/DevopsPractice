Docker 
  There are two types of services 
  (1) monolithic EC2:**multiple services are deployed on single server with single database.**
  (2) MicroServices:**multiple services are deployed on multiple servers with multiple database.** 
 
  CONTAINERS:
  it's the same as a server/VM.
  it will not have any operating system.
  os will be on images.
  (SERVER=AMI, CONTAINER=IMAGE) 
  
    DOCKER: 
    Its an free & opensource tool.
    it is platform independent.
    used to create, run & deploy applications containers.
    it is introduced on 2013 by solomenhykes & sebastian phal.
    We used GO laguage to develope the docker.
    here we write files on YAML.
    before docker user faced lot of problems, but after docker there is no issues with the             application. 
    
    **CONTAINERIZATION:**
      Process of packing an application with its dependencies.
      ex: PUBG
